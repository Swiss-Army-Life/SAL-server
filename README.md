- [x] As a new DIY-er, I want an easily accessible database of interesting projects, so that can immediately find what I am looking to build.
- [x] As an experienced DIY-er, perhaps older, I want to be able to share my extensive knowledge with someone who might not have been exposed to my type of creations.
- [x] As a non-builder user, I want to be able to see projects with photos, purely as a voyeur.
- [x] As an experienced social media user, I want to see the familiar social media setup of scrolling through other user’s DIY’s.
- [ ] As a casual weekend DIY-er, I want to be inspired by the top ranking projects that others with my interest have already ‘liked’ or tried.
- [ ] As a DIY influencer, I want to be able to share my photos and gain likes.
