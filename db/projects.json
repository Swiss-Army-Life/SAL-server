Starting with the back panel this is mounted to the wall with the French cleat system and wrapped with RF LED strip controlled by a remote. To the left corner, there’s a drink holder. In the middle section of the desk, there is an integrated power outlet with two USB ports. To the right of that, there’s a small desk grommet to pass wires through giving the desk a clean look. As a way to stay wire-free, there is a hidden wireless charger. The bottom is removable so if any electronics ever fail you can easily replace it. Last but not least, the desk is designed as a two-part system to easily break down and transport.",

I hope that this is a prime example of what can be achieved in a relatively small space, and that you don't always have to follow the norms when it comes to growing your own food. No dig gardening is a wonderful method of growing food as it brings a whole host of benefits. Not only are you saving time and effort in the garden, you're also improving the health of your soil and as a result, the health of your plants.

In one year using this method you could have thousands of Basil plants all from the original mother plant. I use time-lapse photography to document the growth at every stage.Basil propagates very easily from cuttings and within a month those cuttings are established plants which can then be used to take more cuttings. At each stage of making new plants there are always plenty of leaves which can be used for cooking. Once you get enough plants to provide for your needs you can stop taking cuttings and just harvest the stems as you need them.",

Not only will it help protect from food splatters, but the backdrop is what most people will comment on when they see a new kitchen design. Whether you decide to incorporate a backsplash that goes from the countertop to the hood or straight up to the ceiling is up to you—either way, you can't go wrong. Another reason we love marble is it has the most stunning natural color palette: subtle neutrals of white, creams, grays, and gold. These earth tones will never look dated.",

        "description" : "Ronald Pothier is a potter having started all the way back in 1973 at only the age 13! Today, he works out of his studio in Hemmingford, Quebec where he produces beautiful ceramic pieces of art. Bowls, plates, cups, vases, teapots and more, they are strong and practical for everyday use in your kitchen. Watch as Ronald throws two different teapot designs with such confidence and ease. He makes it look easy but throwing clay on a wheel is quite the workout while also requiring a fine level of finesse. Later on, Ronald explains how he fires, decorates and glazes his pottery and then we see the final result of all the hard work. It's a multistage process that takes several weeks to complete and decades of experience to perfect.",
